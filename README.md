# CSE405 Progress Reports

Assignment 1 Javascript:
   For this assignment I watched some Tutorials on JavaScript and followed a guide on creating a simple calculator. I plan to go back and edit the design and implement more functionality. I placed the tutorials I used in the code and plan to expand more on it.


Assignment 2 Node.js:
  Currently I am watching tutorials and learning about node.js. Im not entirely sure what I will do with it but I am starting to understand it.
